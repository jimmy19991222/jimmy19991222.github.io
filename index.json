Structural Similarity Index(SSIM) mimics human perception by focusing primarily on edge and texture similarity.\nWe cut pictures into patches and compare them patch by patch to compute SSIM. Given patch $x$ from image $I_1$ and $y$ from another image $I_2$, we compute several statistics, including\n$\\mu_x$, $\\mu_y$: the average of $x$ / $y$ $\\sigma_x^2$, $\\sigma_y^2$: the variance of $x$ / $y$ $\\sigma_{x,y}$: the covariance of $x$ and $y$ Then the similarity of luminance between patches can be expressed as $$ l(x, y)=\\frac{2\\mu_x\\mu_y}{\\mu_x^2+\\mu_y^2} $$ If there is a big difference between $x$ and $y$, $l(x,y)$ will be close to 0; If they have similar luminance, $l(x,y)$ will be close to 1. $l(x, y)$ is scale-invariance.\nThe similarity of contrast between patches can be expressed as $$ c(x,y) = \\frac{2\\sigma_x\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x^2+\\sigma_y^2} $$ If one patch is much \u0026ldquo;flat\u0026rdquo; than the other, the score close to 0; If both have the same contrast level, the score is close to 1. Contrast score compares the number of \u0026ldquo;textures\u0026rdquo; in an image block. This formula is also scale-invariant.\nThe similarity of structure between patches can be expressed as $$ s(x, y) = \\frac{\\sigma_{x,y}}{\\sigma_x\\sigma_y} $$ Scores are high when two patches contain edges with the same position and orientation; while low if the patches differ on the location of the edges.\nThe overall SSIM score is the product of these three scores. Some small constants are added to prevent division by zero. SSIM will return a similarity index averaged over all channels of the image. The value is between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to perfect fit.\nPapers PSENet: Progressive Self-Enhancement Network for Unsupervised Extreme-Light Image Enhancement Most work focused on over-expose condition, while PSENet focused on under-expose condition.\nIn-camera image signal processors usually use highly nonlinear operations to generate the final 8-bit standard RGB image.\nReference Similarity measurement (PSNR and SSIM) All about Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 什么是SSIM？ PSENet: Progressive Self-Enhancement Network for Unsupervised Extreme-Light Image Enhancement ","permalink":"https://jimmy19991222.github.io/posts/enhencement/lowlight_enhance.html","summary":"Background Similarity measurement(PSNR and SSIM) PSNR Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is to check the similarity of differences.
