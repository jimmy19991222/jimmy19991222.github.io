Assign the largest IOU (global) to matched bounding box. IOU Intersection over Union (IOU) is to compute the similarity between two boxes.\n0 is no overlap, 1 is full overlap A special case of Jacquard index\ntwo given set A and B $$ J(A, B) = \\frac{|A\\cap B|}{|A\\cup B|} $$ NMS Non-Maximum Suppression\nEvery anchor box predict a bounding box NMS can merge those similar anchor boxes select the largest predict value(confident) and class is not negative(background) Abondon other boxes which IOU larger than a threshold repeat these steps How to generate anchor boxes? generate those anchor boxes with widths and heights as $ws\\sqrt{r}$ and $hs/\\sqrt{r}$, where w, h is width and height of the picture, s is scale of anchor box, r is the ratio. It is over all the pixel in picture.\nCommon method is to consider best scale $s_1$ and with all the $r$, and $r=1$ with all $s$ $$ (s_1, r_1), (s_1, r_2),\u0026hellip;,(s_1, r_m),(s_2, r_1), (s_2, r_1),\u0026hellip;,(s_n, r_1) $$ number is n+m-1\nR-CNN Region-CNN (R-CNN)\nSelective search to select anchor box pre-trained model to get features from every anchor box train a SVM to classify train a Linear regression model to predict the offset fo every box ROI pooling to get different size anchor boxes batched\nFast RCNN get feature from CNN find feature map by same-proportion dividing of anchor box RoI pooling Full-connected layer Faster RCNN Two stage. Use region proposal network(RPN) to substitute the selective search\nRPN input: global feature map\noutput: high-quality anchor box after NMS\nRPN: use CNN to binary classify anchor boxes and regression the offset\nmap is high, but very slow\nMask R-CNN After RoI align, use fully convolutional network(FCN) to get mask prediction\ndo semantic segmentation\nSSD single shot detection\nMulti-scale feature\nwithout RPN, all anchor boxes are predicted\nLower stage to detect the small object, upper stage to detect the large object\nssd is fast, but map is very low.\nYOLO you only look once\nSSD have those anchor boxes overlapped. A large waste of computation.\nuniformly separate picture into SxS anchor boxes.
